# A Deep Learning Approach to Optimal Investment With Transaction Costs

In [code](./code) you find the PyTorch implementation of the numerical method proposed in my master's thesis [thesis.pdf](./thesis.pdf) to approximate the optimal trading strategy and the optimal risky fraction in a Black-Scholes model with transaction costs.

The results along with the trained neural networks of the experiments of Chapter 4 are provided in [/code/results](./code/results).

To run the code and to train your own neural network clone this repository and execute the jupyter notebook [code/showcase.ipynb](./code/showcase.ipynb).
